# dsh-notify-bark

[![awesome · DSH plugin](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com/badge.svg)](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com)

> **License:** MIT · **Requires:** Node ^22.19 · **Platform:** DSH Host + Web settings page

**[English](README.md) · [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)**

A [Bark](https://github.com/Finb/Bark) push-notification plugin for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH): the **DSH Host** listens for events such as turn completion, waiting for your answer, and waiting for approval, and pushes notifications to your iPhone through a Bark Server. Notifications are sent entirely from the Host — closing the browser, refreshing the page, or putting your computer to sleep does not affect delivery.

- **Host half** (`src/index.ts` + `lib/*.js`): session/event listener + Bark HTTP sending + `bark` settings namespace (`ctx.settings` → `settings.yaml`, hot-reloaded) + `/dsh-notify-bark` loopback RPC.
- **Browser half** (`src/client/` + `lib/client.js`): registers a `settings.section` slot; the form reads and writes Host config through the RPC. **The Bark URL never crosses the wire to the browser** — only a masked status is shown (configured: `••••••••3F82`).

## Notification events (9 switches)

| Event | Trigger | Default | Bark level |
| --- | --- | :-: | --- |
| ✅ Task completed | `turn/end` reason `completed` | On | `active` |
| ❌ Execution failed | `turn/end` reason `error` | On | `timeSensitive` |
| 🚫 Execution blocked | `turn/end` reason `blocked` | On | `timeSensitive` |
| ⏹ Aborted | `turn/end` reason `aborted` | Off | `passive` |
| ⚠️ Token limit reached | `turn/end` reason `max-tokens` | On | `timeSensitive` |
| ⏸ Interrupted | `turn/end` reason `interrupted` | On | `timeSensitive` |
| ❓ Awaiting your answer | `tool/call` `ask_user_question` | On | `timeSensitive` |
| 🔐 Awaiting your approval | `approval/asked` | On | `timeSensitive` |
| 📋 Plan awaiting confirmation | `tool/call` `exit_plan_mode` | Off | `timeSensitive` |

The notification title is fixed to the workspace name (last path segment of `session.header.cwd`); the status is placed on the first line of the body. Optional extras: the AI's last reply text, a body length cap, and a Bark Group.

## Installation

Install directly from GitHub (the repo ships compiled output — clone and use, no build step required):

    dsh plugin --profile web add https://github.com/pc439527/dsh-notify-bark.git

Or from a local path:

    dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-notify-bark

`dsh plugin add` runs `pnpm add` (writing dependencies + `dsh.profile.bundles`), and the plugin's own `cordis.patch.yml` inserts the `bark-notify` line. **A running dsh web watches the profile's `cordis.patch.yml` through Cordis HMR** — appending the same insert line at the user layer hot-loads the plugin without restarting the service:

    # $DSH_HOME/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml
    - insert:
        - id: bark-notify
          name: 'dsh-notify-bark'

Refresh the browser settings page (gear → Bark notifications) to see the configuration form.

## Security & privacy

- **No built-in keys:** `barkUrl` defaults to empty; each deployer fills in their own Bark URL on the settings page (`https://api.day.app/your-key`). This repository contains no real credentials (tests use only a fake `testkey`).
- **Credentials never reach the browser:** `barkUrl` is declared `role('secret')` in the schema; the RPC returns only a masked status (configured: `••••••••3F82`) and logs only `configured: true/false`.
- **Config is stored on the Host only:** written to the Host-side `settings.yaml` and never uploaded to any third party; notifications are sent only to the Bark URL you configured.

## Development

    pnpm install        # typescript / @types/node (lockfile: pnpm-lock.yaml)
    pnpm run build      # tsc compiles the Host half to lib/; the client bundle is maintained directly in lib/client.js
    pnpm test           # node:test unit tests (send layer / event mapping / defaults / dedup / masking)

## Design notes

- **Notifications go through the Host:** `ctx.on('session/event')` listens directly (the same path dsh-im-bridge uses); the browser is only a configuration panel.
- **Config is stored on the Host:** the `bark` namespace is registered into `ctx.settings` and persisted to `settings.yaml`; DSH's web settings wire has a namespace whitelist (`WEB_SETTINGS_NAMESPACES`), and third-party namespaces go through `settings-not-exposed`, so the settings page uses a dedicated RPC (same architecture as dsh-codex-auth) to read and write.
- **Credentials never reach the browser:** `barkUrl` is `role('secret')` and the RPC returns only masked status (`configured: ••••••••3F82`); logs output only `configured: true/false`.
- **Event dedup:** `sessionId` + `event.seq` key with a bounded ledger, so reconnects or replays never push duplicates.
